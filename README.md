# Symmetric Matrix Visualizer

All code and documentation in this repository was written by Claude Sonnet 3.5.


## Description
The Symmetric Matrix Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and manipulate symmetric matrices in a cyberpunk-themed interface. This tool is designed to help users understand the concept of matrix symmetry, particularly in the context of covariance matrices, through a visually engaging and interactive experience.

## Features
- Interactive matrix size adjustment (1x1 up to 10x10)
- Random matrix generation
- Real-time matrix editing with symmetry maintenance
- Color-coded visualization of matrix components:
  - Diagonal elements (variance)
  - Upper triangle elements
  - Lower triangle elements
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Cyberpunk-inspired UI with neon color scheme and glow effects

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyberpunk-matrix-visualizer.git
   cd cyberpunk-matrix-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
- Use the slider to adjust the size of the matrix
- Click "Generate Random Matrix" to populate the matrix with random values
- Click on any cell to edit its value manually
- Observe how changes in one cell are reflected symmetrically across the diagonal
